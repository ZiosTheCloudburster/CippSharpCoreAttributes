Attributes by default use FULL property drawers so, MULTIPLE of them are not displaying correctly.
A property Drawer overrides the other and so on. 
The attribute order property WORKS only with Decorators, as UNITY clearly says: https://docs.unity3d.com/ScriptReference/PropertyAttribute-order.html

Some decorators are 'experimental' and they 'target' however the property context / reference because they're intended to do some checks
or display something contained at SerializedProperty level but not edit how property is displayed.
Retrieving the right property context is made contextual on active editor so it's not 100% certain that works everywhere and with anything.
